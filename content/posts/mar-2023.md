Burton White, CEO of Excella and a New Orleans native, will fly back home and
join us to discuss building tech ecosystems. He'll share things Excella has done
in D.C., and discuss what we can do in New Orleans to build a larger and more
dynamic tech community.

Excella.com is sponsoring food and drink for the event. After the talk, we
encourage everyone to go to #Hacknight at the Rusty Nail.

Jï»¿oin us at @The Shop.
