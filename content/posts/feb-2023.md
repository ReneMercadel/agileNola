Have you ever wondered how VMs work? What is the difference between a process VM
and a System VM? Why would you use it? Did you know you could code your own VM?

Process VMs power your favorite languages like Javascript, Python, Java, C#, and
many more. Join us this month as Benjamin Eckel shows us how to code our own
Process VM. If you walk in knowing a little bit of Javascript, you will walk out
with an understanding of how these VMs work.

Please join us this month for a lot of networking and a little knowledge @ the
Shop.

Everyone is encouraged to go to Hack Night after the presentation @ the Rusty
Nail. Food and drink during the presentation are sponsored by Excella.
